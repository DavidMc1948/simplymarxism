<h2>Support Science and Oppose the Green Movement</h2>

<p>
While greens have better instincts than many on a range of social issues such as inequality and racism, and they are hardly likely to rally behind counter-revolutionary tyrants, their opposition to material progress is a major problem. They believe that the global abundance required to lay the basis for communism is unachievable because of “limits to growth” or “planetary carrying capacity”. However, prosperity for all is not difficult to imagine with scientific and technological advances. Where land is a constraint, we can build higher into the sky and tunnel deeper into the ground. Precision farming, biotechnology and other innovations will provide far more food while using less land and water, an already established trend that is gathering pace in spite of opposition from greens. There will be limitless supplies of clean energy from a range of resources. We can already be sure that future generations of nuclear power technology would be able to rely on virtually inexhaustible fuel resources. Then there are future technologies we can presently only guess at. For example, biotechnology may open up new ways of harnessing the sun. The mineral resources we rely on are more than sufficient, even without considering future access to extra-terrestrial resources and our ability to devise ways to substitute one resource for another. We will protect the biosphere with more advanced and better funded waste and conservation management. Indeed, in many respects we have seen capitalist countries get cleaner as they get richer.
</p>
<p>
Just as we can thrive with possibly 11 billion people in 2100, we can thrive if there is a lot more in 2200. A mix of currently conceivable and not yet conceivable advances in science will make this manageable. At some stage we can expect our descendants to transform themselves into a post-human species with totally new needs, and new abilities to harness nature to meet them. And as they head off into the rest of the solar system and beyond, they will no longer be held back by any earthly constraints.  
</p>
<p>
Greens are not content to declare the impossibility of economic growth. They do whatever they can to oppose it and tell us that we do not need it.
</p>
<p>
They constantly make false claims about the environmental or health impact of a product or production process. This is often assisted by junk science produced by greens working in university science departments.
</p>
<p>
Perversely, they undermine efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. We need a massive growth in output to meet the needs of 9-10 billion people, including the 4 billion or so in Sub-Saharan Africa by the end of the century. This requires the retention and expansion of nuclear power and extensive research into new emission free technology in energy, agriculture and industry.
</p>
<p>
However, according to the greens, emission reductions should be achieved through renewable energy and lower consumption of energy and everything else. In tune with certain commercial interests, they falsely claim that renewable energy is not much dearer than fossil fuel-based energy and is all we need.
</p>
<p>
Billions of dollars have been wasted on subsidizing the deployment of wind and solar power instead of being spent on seeking out real solutions. Nuclear power is in the doldrums whereas it should be thriving. Meanwhile, renewable energy has scarcely made a dent on fossil fuel consumption.
</p>
<p>
Next on the list of green misdeeds is their opposition to modern agriculture. Greens in league with the “organic” food industry want us to reduce effective crop yields by relying on legume rotation for fertilizer and foregoing pesticide and modern biotechnology. At the same time, they want us to rely more on manual labor rather than energy consuming machinery.
</p>
<p>
Certainly, synthetic fertilizer and pesticide needs to be used more judiciously in some regions. Also, you would not rush into capital intensive agriculture where it just leads to a labor surplus. However, reducing our use (and abuse) of land and water while increasing food production requires being as “unnatural” as possible. It needs lots of energy, water treatment, and new technology such as precision farming and biotechnology.
</p>
<p>
As well as opposing economic growth, many greens relish the idea of going back to a more primitive economy.  They seek a steady state economy based on small scale local production. They have the delusional idea that such a mode of production would provide more rewarding and less alienating work than under the present system. This is based on a romanticized picture of pre-industrial society full of happy artisans and self-sufficient peasants, and silly chatter about how people in poor countries are happier than people in rich ones.
</p>
<p>
They claim that for production to be sustainable it should be kept to what is possible on the basis of renewable and reusable resources and we should forego large-scale use of depletable metals and other minerals. They claim such an economy would deliver wholesome “sufficiency”. In fact, it would deliver abject poverty just as it did in the past.
</p>
<p>
Those greens who are the most ‘radical’ and anti-capitalist and therefore the most ‘left’ are in fact the most reactionary. If what they advocate were taken seriously it would mean making industry small-scale and local. This would rule out many technologies and products. Virtually the only source of energy would be firewood as solar panels and wind turbines would be impossible or too expensive to produce. An electric light bulb would have the same problem. Computers, telecommunications and anything electronic would be out of the question. The primary source of locomotion would be draft animals and their numbers would be limited by the fact that their calorie consumption per head is many times that of a human. Productivity would plummet with the reversion to more labor-intensive technologies with most time devoted to producing food, clothing and other basics. There would be no ability to deal with natural disasters, including those resulting from climate change, nor to move large quantities of grain in the case of a local crop failure.
</p>
<p>
Of course, such a society, at least in the more developed regions would be able to cannibalize from the old society for a while. The housing stock and sewerage system will take a generation to badly deteriorate. There will be plenty of scrap metal. However, the uses that could be made of this would be limited by the simple technology available. For example, a bicycle, assuming it could still be produced, would be very expensive. And this assumes that this stock of leftovers is not shared with the billions in the poorer regions. If Mad Max is anything to go by, they would be coming to “share”, whether you like it or not.
</p>
<p>
As the material conditions regressed to those before capitalism, so would the social and political, with local thugs exacting tribute and fighting each other over the spoils.  From these backward economic and political conditions, humanity would then, just as we did in the past, eventually take the painful path back to capitalism and modernity.
</p>
<p>
The natural environment would not benefit from this madness. Reverting to firewood and pre-industrial agriculture is no way to preserve the environment with our population levels. Some exponents understand this and put their hopes in a massive “die back” where the population is reduced to a mere fraction of its present level. They see people as an environmental problem, akin to pollution, rather than as the inventive motive force in history.
</p>
<p>
To ensure that we can continue down the road of economic progress while reducing our impact on the natural environment will require a lot of science and technological innovation. Marxists can make a worthy contribution by standing up to the green tide.
