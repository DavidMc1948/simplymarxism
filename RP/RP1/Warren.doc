nin is referring to the increasing obsolescence of capitalism, exemplified most starkly by two world wars and economic crises of the sort that hit in the 1930s and will hit again in the future. He is not saying that social and economic development ceases.
 In his use of the word `stagnation', Lenin is not saying that capitalism is no longer revolutionising the productive forces - a proposition that would obviously be wrong. He is referring to its increasing tardiness relative to a communist organisation of
 production - the productive forces are outgrowing the capitalist mode of production. Warren tries to equate Lenin's description of monopoly capital and imperialist countries as parasitic with the crude 'surplus drain' view. However, Lenin is not denying 
that the export of capital develops the productive forces in recipient countries; he is just saying that the centralisation in the ownership of capital shows up geographically. Places such as London and New York have a far higher than average proportion o
f the world's bloodsuckers; they tend to be richer and their 'portfolios' span the world. When Lenin explicitly discusses the impact of imperialism on the then colonies, he says that it was developing the productive forces. Warren unjustifiably shrugs thi
