With everyone economically secure, there would be no need for the government to pay. There would be no hardship in having </span><span class="c0">user</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">pays</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;for routine primary care, and have health savings accounts and mutual insurance schemes for the more expensive and serious care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, after further thought I cannot see any reason for not going to totally free health care funded out of taxes. This is because health care generally does not need to be left to the individual because people do not have different preferences. We want lots of it and when we have a medical condition, our preference for it is </span><span class="c7 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_preferences&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1586949255046000">lexicographic</a></span><span class="c1 c0">. In other words, if we need a triple bypass, any bundle of goods and services that does not include that treatment would be less preferred to one that does. You could say the same about any other catastrophic health event. To put it in less fancy terms, freedom from pain and disability is very much an overriding need. Nothing else comes close to it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">At the same time, people who require little health care would want &nbsp;to help others get what they, out of good luck, do not need. It is just a matter of empathy. This is especially so if others are making healthy lifestyle choices which is what you would expect with the end of capitalist alienation. As for the healthy young subsidizing the less healthy old, I do not think this is a big deal. When they get old they in turn will be subsidized by the young.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Of course, there is a limit to what we would commit to health care funding. Even if health were virtually the sole priority, you still need to devote resources to food, clothing, sanitation, housing and sport which also affect health. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">While lots of fancy new equipment &nbsp;and a large research and development bill will push up health spending, it will at the same time be pushed down by healthy living and medical advances such as new drugs and gene therapy that reduce the need for long and expensive treatment. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">I have already explained in the CEA piece that under social ownership you do not have the tax worries that appear to be a problem under capitalism. So paying for free universal health care would not be a problem. I said &nbsp;that income tax would not have to be progressive. Wage rates would be much more equal and disparities would be there for a good reason and ought not be undone through the tax system. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">My point would have been clearer if I had explained how high tax rates on the lower tax brackets would encourage work rather than deter it. (Work deterrence of income tax is a mantra of most economists.) It would discourage people from working less than others through going part time or taking long breaks while at the same time enjoying tax free goodies with everyone else. A poll tax would also encourage work. You have to work to pay for it. A land tax/rent on high demand residential locations that I also refer to might also have the same effect, as those working shorter hours will have trouble bidding against those working longer hours. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">I also mention that tax collection, compliance and avoidance costs would be a fraction of what they are now. There would be no more capitalists hiring an army of people to minimize their tax bill nor would there be a need for a taxation bureaucracy chasing down tax evaders.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">We are warned that state provision would mean waste and compromised service. Firstly, those purchasing and delivering services will be cavalier about costs and their choices may not correspond with &nbsp;the highest value from the point of view of recipients. &nbsp;Secondly, while recipients will be concerned about getting the best care, they will not be so concerned about whether it is delivered in the most economical fashion and will not be fussed about a bit of overservicing that brings no benefits.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">This is where the proletarian revolution comes in. The socialism we are talking about here is not simply state ownership of the means of production. It is that plus a working class in power that is committed to putting in the hard yards to transform itself and society. This means creating a world where work has become something people want to do for its own sake and is performed to produce the best outcomes. This is a conception of social ownership that is discussed in a number of articles on this sight.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">return to Simply Marxism home</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p></body></html>
