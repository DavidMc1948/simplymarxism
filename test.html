  <strong>A Model of a Socially Owned Economy that Relies on Decentralized Prices</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  This paper sets out a  model of social ownership based on decentralized pricing with the aim of  challenging the view that the Austrian School economists won the socialist economic calculation debate. It is not the only challenge. The other challenge I am aware of is a <a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/">model of central planning</a> by Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell.  Their model relies on modern information technology and also a defence of labor hours as a measure of cost.  I will give a brief overview of that model as an appendix.   </p>
  <p>
  I am not making any claims about what would actually transpire after a revolution that dispossesses the capitalists. The purpose is simply to argue that there is nothing about social ownership that prevents the use of decentralized pricing.
